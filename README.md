# star-plus-back-end-integration
 It's the same Star plus of previus project, but with a entire integration with Database MySQL using Flask, a Python's framework

 
Attention to the use of the program:
[1] You should enable access to your MySQL localhost using XAMPP or WAMPP (Tutorial on YouTube).
[2] You must create a database in MySQL using the CREATE DATABASE (database name) command.
[3] You should link your database in line 22 of the program using create_engine.
[4] Yout should start the site using the 'main.py' file, because it's the file that will link the front end to the Data base.
[5] The provided ZIP code (CEP) must be from specific locations; it cannot be from cities/states or (00000-000) because they haven't street addresses.
